Compound Bow (for people that know about archery):
sorry about not having two cams on the bow, but Pivot kept glitching, and so i had to use a 
crappy looking wheel instead.
but i'm going to improve on it later on, and make some fills.
thanks for using it, and please give credits to me - maxedcouch - for making it.

Enjoy!
